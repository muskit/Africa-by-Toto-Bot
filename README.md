# "Africa by Toto" Twitter Bot
This is a Twitter bot that tweets each line from the song *Africa* by Toto at an interval.

## Running
Make sure a `.env` file in this folder with appropriate tokens filled (see `main.py`; it's not hard to figure out). Then:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## TODO
- when starting bot, resume from previous position in event of crash
